HELPFILE - Quick command reference (updated 09/19/2005).

  Type 'q' to exit the reference file.

  Note this file is written specificially for the foam machines
  in LH.  Refer to the manual for more information.  Refer to the
  code for features I haven't gotten around to finishing and/or
  documenting yet.  Email me <rvarick@indiana.edu> with questions.

Program control:
  * quit, q - exit
  * help, h - show this page
  * ga <number of runs> - run the genetic algorithm

Hardware:
  * hardware <flag> - change hardware protocol (default: v1-foam)
     * supported flags: v1-foam, v1-silicon, v2-usb
  * eac <location> - change the active eac
     * default is: eac3.cs.indiana.edu

EAC control:
  * source/sink <channel> <current> - add source or sink
     * channel:  1-8, current:  0-200 (uA)
  * lla <channel> <function> - configure lla
     * channel: 1-6, function: 1-27
  * report-lla <channel> - reports the current an lla sees
     * what you'll see is the amount of current going in to the
       LLA, then the output coming out of the LLA [1]
  * reset - set all sources and sinks to 0 uA
  * report - get the voltage gradient values
  * plot - create a .jpg plot of the voltage gradient
  * view - view a voltage plot
  * rpv <number> - shortcut for 'report plot view'
     * <number> is the number of successive times to report the gradient

Data management:
  * clean - reset the current data directory
  * save - create a new data directory, saving the current on
  * load - load a previous data directory

Debugging information:
  * feedback <on|off> - toggle general feedback
  * debug <on|off> - toggle general debug information
  * debug-comm <on|off> - toggle communication debugging
  * debug-logging <on|off> - toggle file I/O debugging
  * debug-ga <on|off> - toggle GA debugging
  * test-mode <on|off> - toggle communication with the EAC 

Parameters (incomplete):
  * current-scaling, elites, fitness-threshold, generations
  * mutation-rate, min-current, max-currrent, noise-rate,
  * noise-scaling, noncoding-prob, psize

Toggles (incomplete):
  * crossover, tournament-selection
